## Types of Shell
- Interactive vs Non-Interactove
    - Interactive: attached to the terminal (TTY) and allows you to send commands and see the results
    - Non-Interactive: not attached to the TTY and cannot receive commands
        - Used to run scripts
- Login vs Non-Login
    - Login: a login shell is started when a shell is required as part of the login process (e.g. ssh into a server)
        - Will execute any commands or set any confguration required as part of starting the session
    - Non-Login: a non-login shell will set any configuration specific to setting up the sell itself (rather than the session)
        - Example: the shell you get from graphical session when you start the Terminal (you are already logged in the machine by the graph interface)
- Bash config files order
    - For interactive login shell
        - If system admin has configured this file: /etc/profile
        - Then will read from the first of the following files (if exist)
            - ~/.bash_profile
            - ~/.bash_login
            - ~/.profile
        - When the shell ends:
            - ~/.bash_logout
    - For interactive non-login shell
        - Will first read /etc/bash.bashrc
        - Then will read ~/.bashrc
- Z-Shell config files order
    - For interactive login the following files are executed in order:
        - /etc/zshenv      -> to set global env variables
        - ~/.zshenv        -> to set local env variables
        - /etc/zprofile    -> if exists
        - ~/.zprofile
        - /etc/zshrc       -> if exists
        - ~/.zshrc         -> to set up local aliases, options and custom prompt
        - /etc/zlogin      -> if exists
        - ~/.zlogin        -> to finish local setting up the interactive logging shell
        - When the shell ends:
          - ~/.zlogout
    - For interactive non-login the following files are executed in order:
        - /etc/zshenv      -> to set global env variables
        - ~/.zshenv        -> to set local env variables
        - /etc/zshrc       -> if exists
        - ~/.zshrc         -> to set up local aliases, options and custom prompt
